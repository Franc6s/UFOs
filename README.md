# UFOs

## Purpose of the project 

The purpose is to have an interactive website that hold information about UFO sightings, and in which data can be filtered. This allow a any user to filter data and access information needed instead of going through a whole list.

## Results

First of all, four new filters were added in the initial index.html file. Below is the html code :

and on the website it shows :

The data can be filtered by Date, City, State, Country, and the Shape of the UFO. In my analysis below, I will provide the image of the HTML code, and the result at the front end.

### Date Filter
The html code for date filter :

when i filter the date for the date 1/12/2010, here are the result :

Here the data is filtered by city once the filter is applied. I chose the city of "fresno"

I filtered the state to California = ca. This filter returned the most result overall.

### Country Filter

In the data.js file, the only country listed was the United States. However, in case there are many countries, it would be a useful filter.

the html code :

I used two filters, country and the "formation" shape

### Shape Filter

This specific filter holds a key information, which is the shape of the UFO. 

the html code :

the filter used are  light, and then triangle

### Multi filters 

I attempted to use multi filter to see if I could narrow the results

#### State : ca, Shape : light, Date : 1/2/2010

## Summary

Though it was a insighful project, the drawback is that it involves a lot of html scripting, and some app coding. On the other hand, it is a useful and user friendly tool that allow to filter information from which patterns can be drawn. My recommandation is to have also data that involves other continents. This will allow Dana to see sightings location patterns.
